## 1. Introduction

The **OMNIA Platform** authorization uses a policy-based model. This policy-based model consists of three main concepts: policies, permissions and roles.

## 2. Policies, permissions and roles

- A policy is composed by one or more permissions.
- A permission is a function/area to protect and has a collection of roles used to evaluate users permissions.
- A role is an easy way to group users of an application based on what they can or cannot do.
