## 1. Introduction

OMNIA Development Environment runs in containers using Docker, allowing the user to manage it's instances using the `docker-compose` PowerShell commands and access to OMNIA Platform logs in Docker Desktop.

You can also choose what version of the Development Environment to install [here](/omnia3_downloads.html#development-environment).

## 2. Stop/Start Development Environment

To **stop** the Development Environment run:

```
    docker-compose -p OmniaPlatform stop
```

To **start** it back again, run:

```
    docker-compose -p OmniaPlatform start
```

You can also **start** the Development Environment by running the "`start.ps1`" script file that's in the Development Environment folder.

## 3. Remove Development Environment

To remove ("_uninstall_") the Development Environment from the machine, you must remove the OMNIA Platform containers from your Docker. For that, you simply need to run:

```
    docker-compose -p OmniaPlatform down --rmi all
```

This will stop every running container from the `OmniaPlatform` project and then remove them all, including it's images.

**NOTE:** This command doesn't remove local storage data.

## 4. Access to OMNIA Platform Logs

Actions in Application side of the OMNIA Platform log information in the Development Environment. They're located inside containers, in `/var/log/omnia`.

To access logs in **real time** open the Docker Desktop and expand the _containers_ of the `OMNIA Platform` project. Now click in a container and you'll be automatically redirected to _Logs_.
