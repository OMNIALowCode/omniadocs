## 2. User Interface

### Lists and Grid columns

The **size** of elements represents the number of columns it covers on Lists or Grids (for example, on collections).
To respect user's desktop screen resolution, there's a limit on Lists and Grids to three resolutions that changes the maximum number of columns the user can see without scrolling:

- Window width **smaller** than `1366 pixels` (720p has a width of `1280px`) displays a maximum of **12** columns;
- Window width **smaller** than `1920 pixels` (1080p) displays a maximum of **16** columns;
- Window width **greater** than `1920 pixels` (1080p) displays a maximum of **20** columns;
