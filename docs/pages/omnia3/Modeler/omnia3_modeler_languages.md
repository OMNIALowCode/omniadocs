## 1. Introduction

The model's language management allow to change which languages are available in the model to the application's end-users.

It's only possible to add a language to the model if the language exists in the platform.
In the __Management__ area it's possible to add new languages to the plaform ([click here](omnia3_modeler_languagetranslator.html) to see how to do it).


## 2. Language Management

A language is defined by:
* Name: A reference to the Platform's language;
* Description: The description of the language (e.g.: to American English can be English (US)). If not written, the Platform's language's description will be used;
* Texts: A collection in which entry is composed by a name and a value, representing the identifier of the text and the translation in the language.
 
By accessing **_Languages_** in the sidebar, you will have access to the languages management screen.

Here you can **Add new** languages, identifying their **Name** and **Description**.

After you create a new language ([see how](omnia3_modeler_languagetranslator.html)), you will be able to change the language's texts.
