## 1. Introduction

The Modeler is the area where the model development occurs.

To create new OMNIA applications you must understand the [modeling lifecycle](omnia3_modeler_lifecycle.html), in order to follow the best development practices.

## 2. Understanding the homepage

Accessing the _Modeler_ you will see three different groups of information:

- **Statistics**: a set of counters to inform you of how many entities the model has;
- **Build information**: the current build version and how many pending changes exists since the last build;
- **History**: the last model changes;

## 3. Understanding the menu

The menu has entries is organized into four areas:

- **Business**: Definition of the [entities](omnia3_modeler_entities.html) that compose the model
- **User Interface**: Definition of all User Interface elements
- **Query**: Definition of queries for [data analytics](omnia3_modeler_datavisualization.html)
- **Model info**: Information about [Build versions](omnia3_modeler_lifecycle.html), changes to the model and statistics.
