## 1. Introduction

The Modeler is the area where the model development occurs.

To create new OMNIA applications you must understand the [modeling lifecycle](omnia3_modeler_lifecycle.html), in order to follow the best development practices.

## 2. Understanding the homepage
Accessing the _Modeler_ you will see three different groups of information:
 * **Statistics**: a set of counters to inform you of how many entities the model has;
 * **Build information**: the current build version and how many pending changes exists since the last builld;
 * **History**: the last model changes;

## 3. Understanding the menu
The menu has entries to each one of the [entities](omnia3_modeler_entities.html), as well to the [data analytics](omnia3_modeler_datavisualization.html) and the [versioning](omnia3_modeler_lifecycle.html) mechanisms.
