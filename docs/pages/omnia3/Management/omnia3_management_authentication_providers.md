## 1. Introduction

On OMNIA Platform we can configure multiple authentication providers, allowing you to deliver a better authentication experience to the end-users.

This feature enables you to provide a single sign-on experience in organizations with AD FS and Authorization with external authorization providers like Google or Microsoft.


## 2. Manage Authentication Providers

By accessing **_Authentication Providers_** in the sidebar, you will have access to the Authentication Providers management screen.

Here you can **Add new** Authentication Provider and select the Type of the Provider.

An Authentication Provider is defined by:
* Name: The unique identifier of the Authentication Provider;
* Label: The label that will be presented to the user when logging in;
* Order: Authentication Providers will be sorted by this order;

After you create or update a new Authentication Provider, you will be advised to **Restart the System, so these changes can take place.**


## 3. Types

The following services are supported:

### 3.1 OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server.

You can use OpenID Connect to integrate with any Authentication Service that supports OpenID Connect, for example:

 - Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
 - Office 365
 - AD FS

When using OpenID Connect you will need to configure the following parameters that you get from the Authentication Service:
