The OMNIA Platform is a fully browser-based application, so in order to use it you will need to have a browser and internet access.

## 1. Browser support
The following browsers are supported:
* Chrome 67 or higher
* Firefox 70 or higher
* Microsoft Edge 79 or higher

## 2. Device Date and Time

In order to correctly authenticate and use OMNIA Applications, the device date and time must be valid for the configured Timezone.

If the device date/time is not correct, a page with the following message will be shown: **Incorrect date/time detected**.

To fix this issue, we suggest changing the device configuration so that the date/time is managed automatically.
