## 1. Introduction

When using a local environment to develop Omnia behaviours, it is suggested to use Omnia-CLI to download the model to a development environment and upload to another environment (local or cloud).

## 2. Download a model

Download of model behaviours to a local environment can be done in two ways:

- Access Omnia Modeler portal, and use option "Download last build"

- Using Omnia-CLI, by executing the following command:

    ```
        omnia-cli model export --subscription [Subscription] --tenant [Tenant] --environment [Environment] --path [Path]
    ```

    **Parameters**

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-------|--------|
    | Subscription | The name of the configured subscription |
    | Tenant | The code of the tenant to be downloaded |
    | Environment | (Optional) The tenant environment. If not inserted, PRD is assumed |
    | Path | (Optional) The path where the model will be downloaded to. If not inserted, the current path is assumed |

    **Example:**

    ```
        omnia-cli model export --subscription local --tenant mytenant --environment PRD 
    ```



## 3. Upload a model

The upload of a model *.zip* file to an environment (local or cloud) can be done in two different ways:

- Access Omnia Modeler portal, and use option "Import"

- Using Omnia-CLI, by executing the following command:

    ```
        omnia-cli model import --subscription [Subscription] --tenant [Tenant] --environment [Environment] --path [Path] --build
    ```

    If *--build* parameter is included, the model will be built after the upload.

    **Parameters**

    | Parameter | Description |
    |-------|--------|
    | Subscription | The name of the configured subscription |
    | Tenant | The code of the tenant to be updated |
    | Environment | (Optional) The tenant environment. If not inserted, PRD is assumed |
    | Path | (Optional) The path of the model behaviours code. If not inserted, the current path is assumed |

    **Example:**

    ```
        omnia-cli model import --subscription local --tenant mytenant --environment PRD --path ../Behaviours/Internal/System --build 
    ```
