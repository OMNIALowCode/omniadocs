## 1. Requirements

- Operating System: Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise
- Software:
  - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (recommended version: 2.3.0.4)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - After VS Code is installed, install extension [Remote-Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- Disk space to install Omnia Development Environment: 3GB

## 2. Install

- Download development environment package [here](omnia3_downloads.html);
- In case of _Security Policy_ errors, open the zip file properties (right click on it and then select "_Properties_"). In the "_General_" tab, check the "_Security_" option and tic the "_Unblock_" box. Click "_OK_";
- Unzip to a folder;
- Open a PowerShell window on that folder;
- Execute file _start.ps1_. Omnia Docker images will be downloaded and its containers created.

> You might get an _Execution Policy_ error during the **first installing**. Run the following command to allow scripts execution:
>
> ```
>        Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
> ```

After the development environment setup ends, a new browser tab with local Omnia installation (endpoint below) is opened. Configure the administrator username and password.
