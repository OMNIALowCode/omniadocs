## 1. Introduction

The development process on Omnia is divided into two different phases:

- Modeling: definition of the Omnia model structure, using Omnia Modeler area on a web browser
- Behaviours: the development of the application business rules, written on supported programming languages.

When developing code for an Omnia application it is important to use the right tools. The use of a development environment that consists of Omnia platform installed on a local machine, an IDE for code development and Omnia-CLI for code syncing is recommended (but not required), so that the developer has full control of the development lifecycle of its applications.

Local installations of Omnia Platform can also be used for demo scenarios.
