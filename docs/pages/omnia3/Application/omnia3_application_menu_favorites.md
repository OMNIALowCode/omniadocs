## 1. Introduction

This feature allows you to select menu entries (not folders) and add them to a new "My Favorites" menu section.

## 2. How to change favorites?

To **add** a new entry to your favorites you just need to mouse over that entry and click on the star icon that appears on the right-side. If this is the first favorite you add, then the new "My Favorites" section will be created above the menu division, right below the collapse menu icon.

On the other hand, if you want to **remove** an entry from your favorites, then mouse over that entry (on the favorites or menu panel) and click on the empty star icon.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Favorites are applied per user, browser and device, which means p.e. users can have a set of favorites on its phone and a different one on its computer.
